# Blog-Note-Taking Mobile Application  
This is a project I have completed for my CS440 (Mobile-App Development) 
class at Azusa Pacific University during my sophomore year. This was a 
project based class, and this is the second project required for the course. 
I completed this project in Fall 2023.

# How to use
This application was developed using the **Expo Go** application 
as the method to visualize the project. You can find it in Google Store
or the Apple App Store. <br/>
In the terminal you will need to install some dependencies
```yaml
  install npm
```
<br/>

Then you can simply run it and scan the QR Code using your phone
```yaml
  npm start
```
<br/>
You also need to set up a **ngrok** localhost machine and connect it to the application to be able to save all the notes taken.

# Technologies used:
**React-Native** - I used React Native as the main framework to develop the layout structure and front-end of the application. <br/>
**React-Navigation** - to be able to move from one screen to another. <br/>
**ngrok** - to be able to connect the application to a localhost machine in the computer to save all the notes taken. <br/>
